# MachineLearning_CW1

Repository contains Jupyter Notebook and two csv files. 

decathlon_Tokyo.csv contains the names of 19 athletes who completed the decathlon at the Tokyo
olympics, along with their results in each event. The columns represent the events in the order they
took place: 100m, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400m, 110m hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, javelin
throw and 1500m.

decathlon_pb.csv contains the the names of 19 athletes who completed the decathlon at the Tokyo
olympics, along with their height (cm), weight (kg), age (months) and personal best (PB) performances
in each event going into the Tokyo olympics.

Jupyter notebook contains code to solve problems set out in machine learning coursework 1 specification 

Problem 1 requires one to preprocess data in csv files, and construct multiple linear regression model to 
predict performance of Thomas Van der Plaetsen in the last 9 decathalon events. Van der Plaetsen was injured 
in the second event and unable to complete the decathalon. 

Problem 2 requires one to explcitly calculate the weights of a multiple linear regression model via 
linear algebra calculations. 

Problem 3 requires one to define random search algorithm with different methods of caulculating alpha to 
return weight history and cost history. Optimal method for calculating aplha is identified. 

Obtained mark of 39/40 on this CW.
